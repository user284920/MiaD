                    they are also one of the most important things in my life, they are for me when I need them. Without them
                    I would not be able to survive, literaly. I love them with all my heart.

                        <p> She is a real one, she tells me things without filter. She gives me advices when I need it.

                            <p> Mya is actually the friend that I have spent more years with, we literally grew up with eachother.
                                When we were starting middleschool we distanciate because we were separated by the groups, I still talked to her 
                                but not like in elementary. Now that she is in my group, she reminded me how much I missed her. She is really sarcastic, but fuuny.
                            </p>
                        <li><STRONG><i>Sofia</i></STRONG></li>
                                <p>Sofia is everything, she never judges me when I do something wrong or weird. She changed schools when starting highschool, I REALLY miss her.
                                    She was my dynamic duo and still is, Sofia complements my personality, she gets me when no one does. She is like another me.
                                </p>
                            
                        <li><STRONG><i>Regina</i></STRONG></li>
                                <p>I love Regina, she is literally perfect. She listens to me when I need her, make me laugh a lot. The words are unesessary to describe how much I care for her.
                                </p>
